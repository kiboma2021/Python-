Python exercises

1. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message 
addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Solution:

    from datetime import date

    name=input("What is your name: ")
    age=int(input("What is your current age: "))
    turn100years=str(date.today().year+100-age)

    print("Hello "+name +",you will be 100 years old in "+turn100years)


2. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

    If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
    Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

3. Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

    Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
    Write this in one line of Python.
    Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.


4. Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.

5. Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.


6. Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)


7. Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

8. Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

    Rock beats scissors
    Scissors beats paper
    Paper beats rock
